# WhoWantsToBeAMillionaire_Game
This program is an interactive trivia game show modeled after the show Who Wants To Be A Millionaire, coded in Java. There are different categories of multiple-choice questions that the player can choose from. The player "wins" money for every question answered correctly, and the game ends if a player gets a question wrong. In addition, there are bonus chances to skip difficult questions. This project was finished in July 2016.

## Installation
Download the .jar and image files in the folder titled JarExecutable_and_Images.

## Usage
Before running the jar file, make sure the jar is in the same folder as the image files. To run the jar through the terminal, cd into the directory with the jar and type this line:
```bash
java -cp ./Millionaire.jar StartGame
```
An application with the graphical user interface for the game will then pop up.
